# Data Analysis with Pandas

______

## Description

<br>
Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.

Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.

For that, in this repo I applied data analysis on the following data sets from kagel:

 * [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) - Sales data from more than 16,500 games
 * [Cycle Share Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset) - Bicycle Trip Data from Seattleâ€™s Cycle Share System
